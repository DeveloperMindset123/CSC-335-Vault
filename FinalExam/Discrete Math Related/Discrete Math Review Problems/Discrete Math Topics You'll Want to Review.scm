;; I will attempt to provide a list of discrete math topics from CSc 104 that I suggest you review.  This
;; list may be updated from time to time.



;; Propositional Logic
;;;
;;;
;;; logical connectives, especially implication.  Contrapositive.  Converse. 
;;; logical equivalence

;;; perhaps more to come



;; Predicate Logic
;;;
;;; quantifiers
;;; free and bound variables 
;;; alpha variant
;;; variable capture
;;;
;;; vacuous truth - see my handout

;;; perhaps more to come


;; Proofs: the idea is to be able to build them yourself
;;;
;;; proof by computation
;;; proof by contradiction
;;; proof by induction
;;;; divide and conquer techniques, including
;;;;; weak induction
;;;;; strong induction
;;;;; structural induction

;;; perhaps more to come


;; Combinatorics
;;;
;;; counting

;;; perhaps more to come




;; Number Theory
;;;
;;; euclidean algorithm
;;; modular numbers 

;;; perhaps more to come


;; Sets
;;;
;;; set operations
;;; cartesian products
;;; well-founded sets
;;; cardinality

;;; perhaps more to come





;; Functions and Relations
;;;
;;; domain and codomain
;;; restriction
;;; the difference between functions and relations
;;; composition
;;; 1-1, into, onto functions
;;; 

;;; perhaps more to come



;; Perhaps More to Come!
