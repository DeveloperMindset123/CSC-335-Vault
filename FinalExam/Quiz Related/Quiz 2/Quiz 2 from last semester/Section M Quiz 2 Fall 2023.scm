;; This is a closed book, closed notes, no devices quiz.  Even the sight of an 
;; open phone or other device will result in your failing the quiz.

;; Design, prove and code an iterative function merge to input two
;; sorted nonnegative integers m and n, with output the sorted integer resulting
;; from merging m and n.  The definition of 'merge' is just as
;; it was in  your algorithms class; you may decide whether 'sorted' means digits
;; in non-decreasing or non-increasing order. Your procedure must preserve
;; multiplicities. You may assume that neither m nor n contain 0s. 

;; Example: for nondecreasing order, (merge 11234 11233345) = 1111223333445

;; Use only functions and numbers -- no lists, no strings, no vectors ...

;; Be sure to provide specifications for your functions.
