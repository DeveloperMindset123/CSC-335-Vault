;; Problem 1 for 2.5 points

;;; correct function which solves the problem with some kind of explanation AND steps toward a corrected
;;; precondition: 2+

;;; mostly correct function which mostly solves the problem without an explanation and without correcting
;;; the precondition : 1.5+

;;; moving in the right direction with clear indication of the path to be followed, with
;;; code which compiles but which is not close to being complete: 1+

;;; something right: 0.5+

;; Problem 2 for 2.5 points

;;; correct bindings for 3 functions and correct computed value: 2+

;;; correct bindings for 2 functions and correct computed value: 1.5+

;;; correct binding for 1 function and correct computed value: 1+

;;; something correct about the bindings and correct computed value: 0.5+
