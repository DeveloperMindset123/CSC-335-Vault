;; Name and Last 4: __________________________________________________________________________________

;; This is a closed book, closed notes, no devices quiz.  Even the sight of an 
;; open phone or other device will result in your failing the quiz.

;; Write your answers on this sheet - if you use additional sheets, you'll need 
;; to put your name and last 4 on those as well.  

;; Problem 1 (3 points)

;; Develop and code a pure R5RS function 3rdSmallestOf5 which inputs 5 numbers 
;; and which outputs the 3rd smallest of these.  You may not use recursion (or 
;; iteration); you may not use either of the min or max primitives.

;; Example: (3rdSmallestOf5 5 2 4 3 1) = 3


;; Problem 2 (2 points)

;; Say that a diamond is a graph of the form

;;                             node
;;                            /    \
;;                           /      \
;;                         node     node
;;                           \       /
;;                            \     /
;;                              node
;;
;; If each node is a frame, as occur in our environment diagrams, and if
;; each edge is an upward directed arrow, is it possible
;; that an environment diagram contains a diamond as a subgraph?  If yes, give a
;; sequence of R5RS scheme function definitions which creates such an environment; 
;; if not, explain carefully why not. You should consider only pure functions, of
;; the kind we have been studying.
